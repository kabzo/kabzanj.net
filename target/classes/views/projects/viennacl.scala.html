<p>
I have applied for the competitive <b>Summer of Code</b> program run by the Institute for Microelectronics in Summer 2014 and was selected as
one of only six students (sponzored by Google Summer of Code 2014). I worked on open-source ViennaCL linear algebra computer library coded in <b>C++</b>.
    ViennaCL is a free open-source linear algebra library for computations on many-core architectures (GPUs, MIC) and multi-core CPUs.
The library is written in C++ and supports CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenMP (including switches at runtime).

I worked on implementing the Fast Fourier Transform,
porting an existing OpenCL-based implementation to CUDA and OpenMP. The outcome of my work is
available to the general public through the free open-source linear algebra library. I have to thank to my mentor
   <b><a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2014/02/mentored-project-ideas-for-gsoc-2014/"  target="_blank"> Karl Rupp </a></b> for his support.
