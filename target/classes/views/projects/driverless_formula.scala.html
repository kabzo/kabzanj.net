<p>
I am currently part of a project at ETHZ which is building an autonomous formula which will compete against another 14 teams in August in multiple disciplines. This is very challanging task since the car needs to be ready to drive fast and especialy, very reliable. The used vehicle is from 2015 fluela which won in many disciplines.

In this project I am in charge of trajectory planning and I am helping in control as well. This is very challanging since the map in not known beforehand and the computational performance on the car is very limited. This is limiting us in the algorihmn choice.
